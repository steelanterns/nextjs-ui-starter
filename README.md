# Nextjs UI Starter

This starter provides a minimal setup.
This starter includes internationalization, chained middleware, Route Groups, internationalization management via sub-paths (/fr, /en, etc.), and a modular architecture optimized for performance and scalability. The aim is to speed up the start-up of a project, while giving developers as much freedom as possible to adapt it to their needs.
